This is an R-package to implement a novel score test method to map group-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that tests for the additive genotypic effect and variability among tissues in a mixed effects model framework. This approach implicitly assumes that the effect of a SNP on gene expression could be in different directions in different tissues. The newest version appliesa closed-form expression of our model and speeds up the computations using templated C++ linear algebra library, Armadillo.
