This is an R-package to implement a novel score test method to map group-specific eQTL that tests for the main genotypic effect and variability among tissues in a mixed effects model framework. Modeling the tissue-specificity as a random effect and the main genotypic effect as a fixed effect results in a two degree-of-freedom test that avoids measuring multiple parameters due to higher number of tissues thus enhancing power. This approach implicitly assumes that the effect of a SNP on gene expression could be in different directions in different tissues.
